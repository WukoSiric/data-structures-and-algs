# Data Structures and Algorithms 
Welcome to my repo where I'll be practicing my data structures and algorithms! It's in Python as I plan to stick to this language for doing Leetcode.

## Study Plan
The iconic [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) will be my baseline. Instead of watching his videos though I'll build my knowledge from good YouTube videos, articles, and the Algorithm Design Manual. 

## Useful Resources
I'm going to keep track of useful webpages or videos I see in this. Depending how diligently I stick to this, it could be moved to the wiki instead :o     

### Sliding Window 

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/MK-NZ4hN7rs/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK-NZ4hN7rs "Sliding Window Technique - Algorithmic Mental Models")

Used this video to learn the whole concept.
* Fixed size sliding window
* Dynamic size sliding window
* Sliding window with auxiliary data structures 
* Max sum subarray of fixed size
* Smallest subarray of sum k 
* Longest substring with distinct k chars
